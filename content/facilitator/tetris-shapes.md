# Tetris Shapes

## Introduction

This creative puzzle is a good exercise in spatial visualtisation and deduction. For most of the
shapes, there is a clear starting point where a certain space can only be filled by one of the
blocks, and a solution can then be logically worked through.

It should be noted that the choice of blocks is arbitrary and only done in reference to the
game ‘Tetris’. The essence of this puzzle can be maintained using blocks of smaller or larger
size, depending on the age and ability of students.

## Solution

The shape which cannot be made by fitting together the blocks given is the Star. It may be
interesting for students to try and reason this logically (see Extension).

The other four solutions, for the Tree, Boat, Spaceship, and Flower, are as follows:

Note that there may be other solutions not given here, any which uses each block once is equally valid.

## Extension

In the case of the star, we can reason as to why is cannot be created from the blocks given:

Firstly, looking at the bottom two points, there is no way to fill this space other than to use
the **S** and **Z** blocks.

If we fill these bottom points, we can consider the remaining three, which have a similar
three-square line structure. We cannot fit the **O** or **T** blocks in these spaces, so we need to
use the **I**, **J** and **L** blocks to fill these three points.

We could attempt to do this in a few ways:

Firstly, we could fill the top point with the **I** block and use the **J** and **L** blocks in the two side points (left on the diagram). At this point, we will not be able to fit the **O** block in the remaining space, so this way will not work.

If we instead fill the top point with either the **J** or **L** block and use the remaining one to fill the side points, along with the **I** block, we will get a situation like on the right of the
diagram. Notice that, had we used the **L** block at the top, rather that the **J**, this would have
given a situation which is a reflection of the case shown in the diagram. In either case, there
is only one space where we can fit the **O** block and after this the remaining space will not fit
the **T** block, so this way will also not work.

Therefore, we have exhausted all possibilities and can conclude that the star shape is
impossible to make from the blocks given.
