# Geometry Puzzle 1

1. Imagine that the Earth is a perfect sphere and imagine we have a large piece of string tied around the equator.

We then add one meter to the length of the string so that now the string is hovering above the equator, still in a circle.

What is the size of the gap between the equator and the piece of string? Enough to fit a piece of paper under? A cat? A car?
