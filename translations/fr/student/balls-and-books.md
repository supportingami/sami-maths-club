1.You have a bag of 5 balls, all of different colors. You take two balls out of the bag.

How many different possible outcomes are there?

What if you add another ball of a new color to the bag (so you have 6)? What about 7 balls?

Is there a similar problem you've already solved?

2.You have 2 blue books and 3 green books. The blue books all look the same and the green books all look the same.
