# Pell Numbers

It can be proven that there are no integer (whole number) solutions to

$\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}$

So there are no integer solutions to

$2b^2 - a^2 = 0$

But can you find positive integer values of a and b that _nearly_ work? That give the answer 1 or -1?

$2b^2 - a^2 = \pm1$

Can you find a pattern to all your solutions?

What does $\frac{a}{b}$ give a good approximation to?
